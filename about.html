										<h2 id="capitalism">About Mitzvah Capital</h2>
									</header>
									<p> <b>Mitzvah</b> is a Hebrew word. It is a Jewish exhortation to <i>do good deeds</i>. </p>
									<p> Mitzvah Capital hijacked the term because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Damski" target="_new">Mel</a>. 
										Mel Damski is a Jewish, Oscar-nomimated, prolific film director that's like a father to me.
										He not only explained that charitable giving fulfilled that religious exhortation 
										to "do good deeds" for Jewish people, but also illustrated how mitzvah was done with his very vivid personal example. </p>
									<p> Mel took the charitable giving aspect of mitzvah to an exteme. He had the habit of giving with almost reckless abandon. 
										He not only gave happily, but also gave frequently. It was breathtaking to behold.
									<p> Charity was his obsession and, unlike most people required to tithe, Mel never gave begrudgingly. He seemed overjoyed in every charitable act. 
										Giving was his <i>joie de vivre</i> and <i>raison d'etre</i>. That munificience inspired the creation of Mitzvah Capital. 
										No doubt, charitable giving is the Mitzvah Capital <i>raison d'etre</i>. </p>
									<p>	Be like Mel. </p>
									<p> Of course, don't gamble, and trade financial instruments wisely if you must, but give generously. Give gladly. Ideally, give to Theravādin monastics. </p>
									<header class="major">
										<h2 id="economics">About Buddhist Economics</h2>
									</header>
									<p> The Aṅguttara Nikāya outlines the rewards of liberality with respect to giving to monastics <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an8.36/en/bodhi" target="_new">here</a>. 
										However, reflecting on monetary economics and capitalism for just a moment, we should realize that money is essentially accounting for a loan. Ideally, at a later date, 
										it allows the creditor the power to purchase the very same good or service exchanged for money in the original transaction (or its market-determined equivalent). 
										It doesn't always work out for creditors though. Credit money has the nasty habit of losing its purchasing power over time. This phenomena is called inflation. </p>
									<p> Sometimes inflation is beneficial. Central banks increase the money supply or influence the price of loans (by controling interest rates) to stimulate the economy. 
										They have the power to manipulate the purchasing power of money because governments pass laws to empower them to juice the economy whenever central bankers think 
										a little stimulation is in order. </p>
									<p> We also have the power to juice the economy around us. By extending credit to those that will pay us back (perhaps with interest) over time, we can all become venture capitalists. </p>
									<p> Giving charitably to monastics is like extending credit to entrepreneurs. Unlike tech entrepreneurs that give society a <i>technological</i> return on investment (<b>ROI</b>), 
										the Theravādin Saṅgha are wisdom entrepreneurs that give society a <i>sagacity</i> ROI. </p>
									<p>	So...</p>
									<p>	If, like King Solomon, you believe that "<a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/392/PRO.3.14-35.CEV">wisdom is better that silver and gold</a>", then <i>voilà</i>: <b>giving to monastics 
										is the ultimate investment</b>. </p>
									<p> That's the Mitzvah Capital position on investing. All other trading and investing is suboptimal. Wisdom capitalism reigns supreme among the various forms of capitalism and 
										it's the foundation of Buddhist Economics. </p>
